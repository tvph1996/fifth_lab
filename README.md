# **GOALS**

- Implement Traefik gateway as a single, secure entry point to force using of HTTPS for communication from the outside.
- Authentication and authorization are handled by Keycloak as an OAuth 2.0/OIDC provider, requiring valid JWT bearer tokens.
- A zero-trust internal network is created by updating to mutual TLS, forcing services to verify each other's identity.

&nbsp;

# **SYSTEM SETUP**

- Two new blocks added to the existing stack: Traefik & Keycloak
- Traefik acts as the gateway, managing all incoming HTTPS traffic and routing it to the internal services while hiding the rest of the system.
- Keycloak handles user login and gives temporary access tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization.
- Used in the lab is an own self-signed CA, which acts as the root of trust for other services, including a root private key (ca.key) for signing other certificates and a public certificate (ca.crt) for verification.
- Similarly, both rest-service and grpc-service also has their respective private key and public certificate.
- In additional, another pair of private key and public certificate is created for localhost, differs from using rest-service certificate as the lab guideline. This is to avoid making rest-service identity visible to the outside, in case the attacker steal localhost, he canâ€™t call grpc-service -> MongoDB directly. Not only that, a separate hostname of a certificate is still better.
- mTLS is setup between rest-service and grpc-service. Both must prove their identity to each other before any communication is allowed, achieving a zero-trust security posture.
